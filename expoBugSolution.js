To resolve this issue, ensure that all native modules are properly linked.  If the package uses a method for linking (such as React Native's autolinking), make sure it's correctly configured in your project.  For older packages that rely on manual linking, you'll need to perform those steps explicitly.  If using Expo Go, the Go version needs to be updated to the correct and updated version for proper linking.  Always check the documentation of the specific package you are using for the correct linking procedure. A clean reinstall of the node modules, and updating the version of Expo may solve this error.
