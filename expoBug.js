This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and attempting to run an app that uses a package that has native modules but fails to link properly.  The Expo CLI might not recognize or correctly handle the native module dependencies, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes during runtime. This can manifest as a build failure or runtime errors related to missing modules or native code.
